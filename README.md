# Omam
An interpreter and compiler for the Omam language: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Omam

Seeing as I'm not developing a compiler for this language the benchmarks are just to show
that you should never use this language for anything. It should be noted that this
interpreter does not have any optimizations built in.


### Benchmarks

| Input       | Time         |
| ----------- |:------------:|
| Mandel.omam | 22 min 7 sec |
